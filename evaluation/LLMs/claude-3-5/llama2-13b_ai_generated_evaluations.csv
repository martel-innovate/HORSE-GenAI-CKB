3. Session Management: This mitigation involves managing user sessions securely to prevent session fixation and other types of attacks. By implementing proper session management, an attacker may be prevented from hijacking user sessions. Priority: 3 (medium-high)
4. Data Validation: This mitigation involves validating all data within the application to ensure it is accurate and has not been tampered with. By implementing data validation, an attacker may be prevented from injecting malicious data into the application. Priority: 4 (medium-low)
5. Access Control: This mitigation involves controlling access to sensitive areas of the application to prevent unauthorized access.

Fuzzing for garnering other adjacent user/sensitive data,[],"

}

The above list includes the following mitigations:

1. Input Validation: This mitigation focuses on validating user input to prevent malicious data from being injected into the system. It is of high priority (1) because it can prevent the attack from occurring in the first place.
2. Error Handling: This mitigation involves handling errors gracefully and logging them for future analysis. It is of medium priority (2) because it can help detect and respond to potential attacks, but it may not be as effective at preventing the attack entirely.
3. Data Encryption: This mitigation involves encrypting sensitive data to prevent it from being accessed or read by unauthorized parties. It is of medium-high priority (3) because it can help protect against data breaches, but it may not be as effective at preventing the attack entirely.
4. Access Control: This mitigation involves restricting access to sensitive data and systems based on user roles and permissions. It is of medium-low priority (4) because it can help limit the damage that can be done by an attacker, but it may not be as effective at preventing the attack entirely.
5. Least Privilege: This mitigation involves granting users only the privileges they need to perform their tasks, rather than giving them full access to the system. It is of low priority (5) because it can help limit the damage that can be done by an attacker, but it may not be as effective at preventing the attack entirely.

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is the third most important mitigation with priority 3, as it can make it more difficult for the attacker to predict the location of sensitive data in memory.

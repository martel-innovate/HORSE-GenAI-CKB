This JSON response contains a list of mitigation names and their priorities for the attack ""Session Credential Falsification through Manipulation"". The mitigations are ranked according to their priority, with the highest priority (1) being applied first. The other mitigations are applied in order of priority, and there can't be two mitigations with the same priority.

The list of mitigations includes:

* Session Token Hashing: This mitigation involves hashing session tokens to make them more resistant to falsification. (Priority 1)
* Session Token Validation: This mitigation involves validating session tokens to ensure they are legitimate and have not been tampered with. (Priority 2)
* User Agent Analysis: This mitigation involves analyzing the user agent string to identify and block suspicious requests. (Priority 3)
* IP Address Restriction: This miterlation involves restricting access to the application based on the IP address of the requester. (Priority 4)
* CSRF Prevention: This mitigation involves protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by adding a token to the request headers. (Priority 5)
